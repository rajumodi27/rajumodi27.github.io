# Understanding Closures in Rust

Rust provides a powerful feature called **closures**, which are anonymous functions that can be stored in variables or passed as arguments. They are commonly used in functional programming patterns and iterator methods.

## Closure Syntax

Closures in Rust use the `| ... |` syntax to define parameters, followed by the function body.

### Example 1: Basic Closure
```rust
let add_one = |x| x + 1;
println!("{}", add_one(5)); // Output: 6
```
- `|x|` represents the closure's parameter.
- The body `x + 1` is the function logic.
- `add_one(5)` calls the closure, returning `6`.

### Example 2: Multiple Parameters
```rust
let multiply = |a, b| a * b;
println!("{}", multiply(3, 4)); // Output: 12
```
Closures can accept multiple parameters, just like normal functions.

## Closures in Iterators
Closures are heavily used in Rustâ€™s iterator methods like `map`, `filter`, and `for_each`.

```rust
let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
let doubled: Vec<i32> = numbers.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect();
println!("{:?}", doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```
- `map(|x| x * 2)` applies the closure to each element in `numbers`.
- `collect()` gathers the results into a new vector.

## Capturing Environment Variables
Closures can **capture** variables from their surrounding scope.

```rust
let factor = 2;
let multiply_by_factor = |x| x * factor;
println!("{}", multiply_by_factor(5)); // Output: 10
```
- The closure captures `factor` and uses it inside the function.

## Closure Types
Rust classifies closures into three traits based on how they use captured variables:
1. **Fn** - Borrows captured variables (`&T`).
2. **FnMut** - Mutably borrows captured variables (`&mut T`).
3. **FnOnce** - Takes ownership of captured variables (`T`).

```rust
fn call_closure<F: Fn(i32)>(closure: F) {
    closure(10);
}
let print_num = |x| println!("Number: {}", x);
call_closure(print_num);
```

## Conclusion
Closures in Rust provide a flexible way to define inline functions, especially for iterator operations and functional-style programming. Understanding closures helps you write more concise and efficient Rust code!
