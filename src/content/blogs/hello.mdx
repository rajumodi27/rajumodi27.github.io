## Project Overview

Rust is a systems programming language focused on speed, memory safety, and concurrency. In this project, we’ll create the classic “Hello, World!” program in Rust as an introduction.

```rust
// Rust Hello World Example
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Code Breakdown

The code is simple, but it introduces some core concepts of Rust:

1. **`fn main()`**: This is the entry point of the Rust program. It is where execution starts.
2. **`println!`**: A macro that prints text to the console. The `!` indicates that it is a macro, not a function.
3. **The text inside the quotes**: This is the message printed to the screen, in this case, `"Hello, world!"`.

## Rust’s Memory Safety

One of the key features of Rust is its ability to ensure memory safety. The language prevents memory leaks and data races without the need for a garbage collector, which makes it unique compared to other programming languages.

```rust
// Ownership and Borrowing Example
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("Rust");
    let t = &s;  // Borrowing reference
    println!("{}", t);
}
```

## Why Rust?

- **Performance**: Comparable to C and C++.
- **Safety**: Prevents null pointer dereferencing and data races.
- **Concurrency**: Rust provides tools for safe concurrency.

## Key Features

- Zero-cost abstractions
- Memory safety without a garbage collector
- Powerful concurrency features
- Cross-platform capabilities

## Future Learning Paths

Once you’re comfortable with “Hello, World!” in Rust, you can:
1. Explore ownership and borrowing in-depth.
2. Learn about Rust’s powerful error handling system with `Result` and `Option`.
3. Start working with Rust’s rich ecosystem for web servers and CLI applications.
4. Understand Rust’s concurrency model to write safe, parallel applications.
